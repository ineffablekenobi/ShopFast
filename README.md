# ShopFast
2-1 Project(Spring)

I have created a base for the projects
Products -> Clothing -> TeeShirt
A product should have the list of users it was sold. so there is a one to many relationship.

IMPORTANT THING I NOTICED IS ID HAS TO BE INT OR BIGINT
AND ALSO ID FOR PRODUCT WAS NAMED product_id

Never use a foriegn key in Contrustor/Getter/Setter
