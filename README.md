# ShopFast
2-1 Project(Spring)

I have created a base for the projects
Products -> Clothing -> TeeShirt
A product should have the list of users it was sold. so there is a one to many relationship.

IMPORTANT THING I NOTICED IS ID HAS TO BE INT OR BIGINT
AND ALSO ID FOR PRODUCT WAS NAMED product_id

The table works. Adding Controllers and Service and Repos now Priority. Adding and Working Login and Role assignments can also be achieved.
